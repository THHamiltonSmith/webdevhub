> WebDevHub is designed to be one central place for developers, that offers a variety of tools to help with any developing needs. This includes code formatters, file converters, image compressors etc.

A central hub with all the tools a developer might need makes it easier to focus on developing, rather then searching for different sites to find a working tool. WebDevHub eliminates this hassle. The site is open-source, designed to be made by the users. If there a feature you want to add, a bug you want to fix etc, simply open a pull request.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to the site:

1. Clone the repository via terminal or github desktop.
2. Run `npm i` to install all needed node packages.
3. In a terminal window opened in the main project directory, run `npm run devStart` to active nodemon, which will restart the test server whenever a change is made. The server can be acessed at `localhost:3000`
4. Create a new file in the `/views` directory titled `your-feature.ejs` and a new JS file in the `/public` directory titled `your-feature.js` in a relevent subfolder.
5. Add a new `app.get` request in the `server.js` file, as such:

```js
app.get("/your-feature", (req, res) => {
    // Render the page with given paramaters.
    res.render("your-path/your-feature", {    // The name of the .ejs file you created including the path
        title: "Your Feature",      // The title of the webpage, usually the same as the feature name.
    });
});
```

6. Code your feature.
7. Add a link to the feature on the home page under a relevant subcategory.
8. (Optional) - Credit yourself at the bottom of your feature using this sample code. Have a look <a href="https://webdevhub.herokuapp.com/image-converter/">here</a> for an example of how it is done.

```html
  <!-- User Credit -->
  <hr class="credit-hr">
  <span class="credit-link">Feature added by <a href="https://github.com/your-username">@your-username</a></span>
```

8. Create a pull request for your new feature.

### Rules/Guidelines for contributing

- Try to follow the site's colour scheme.
- Comment your code as you go and use readable variable names. Its hard to debug code when it looks like Latin.
- Dont delete or change other people's code without a good explanation, or your pull-request wont be approved.
